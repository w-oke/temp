This is Edward Oke's obituary:
Another old pioneer passed away in the person of Edward Oke, at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Arnott, and was laid in Hillside Cemetery beside his wife who predeceased him eight years.  Mr. Oke was born in Cheshire, England 87 years ago.  He came to Canada in his teens and settled in Ontario where he married Elizabeth Brooks.  When the Manitoba craze was on in the 1870s he homesteaded and his whole family moved in 1878 farmed until 1894.  He then moved to Morden, Manitoba and lived here until the death of his wife after which he moved to British Columbia with his daughter, Mrs. W.H. Spencer.  Later he returned to Manitoba and spent the last two years of his life with his daughter, Mrs. Arnott.  Mr. Oke was an enterprising man and had the distinction of planting the first orchard of any size in Morden.  He was a strong supporter of the Methodist church, a zealous Christian loved by all.  Although afflicted for a long time with sciatica he was patient and pleasant with all until he passed away trusting in the Lord.  Three daughters and four sons survive him - David at Hanna, Alberta; Frederick at Darlingford; Mrs. Law, at Morden; Mrs. Spencer, at Coquitlam, B.C.; Frank, at Vancouver;  Wesley at Peace River, Alta; and Mrs. Arnott at Darlingford.
